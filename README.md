This is a personal project related to a game called Fire Emblem Engage

In this game there is a mechanic similar to a gacha game but with more or less predefined appearance odds.
This makes the completion of the objects linked to this gacha possible via the backup system.
Furthermore, in order to facilitate the completion, there is a system of merging the same objects for a higher quality of this item.
Due to the predetermination it is possible to know what you will get no matter where the draw will be done.

My problem is that the ergonomics of the menu and the display of the info in it is not pleasant and to facilitate my access to the information I need, I decided to make a site that will allow me to practice my skills in web development and create a tool that will be useful to me and potentially to others.

For now only a clean database is present.
